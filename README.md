# SF Sandwich Competition Repo

Welcome to Tyler's SF Sandwich competition Streamlit app! We had a blast trying out 9 different sandwich shops,
and using the Streamlit app linked above to record and analyze the results. If you would like to try this out on your
own, I would suggest cloning the repo and trying it out yourself. You'll just need to change
the attendees and sandwich options in the sandwich_setup.py file, but everything else should
work just fine.

Good luck and have fun!
